        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p> Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our favorite curly-cue packaged ramen 
            noodles that remind us of college? That’s this homemade ramen </p>
        <p> On the flip side, this recipe leans more in the direction of I-have-a-package-of-ramen-and-some-vegetables-can-we-make-lunch practical. 
            Sort of healthy and fast and a little nostalgic (packaged ramen!) but also fresh-ly delicious with a ton of flavor. </p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> <li>Ramen noodles (our classic Maruchan package is all we need, sans the seasoning!)</li> <li>Garlic and ginger</li>
            <li>Broth (chicken or veg)</li> <li>Dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Stir-Fry Aromatics</strong> Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.</li>
            <li><strong> Make Your (Easy!) Broth:</strong>  Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.</li>
            <li><strong> Add Noodles: </strong>Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions (more flavor, please!).</li>
            <li> <strong>Veg: </strong>  Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you’d like! Cook until just tender. </li>
            <li> <strong>Top It Off:  </strong>  Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce, whatever your heart desires. </li>
        </ol>
